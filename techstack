Quick setup overview:

Supabase - database schema for products, users, orders, cart items
React - frontend UI
Stripe - handles all payment processing

Key integrations you'll need:

@supabase/supabase-js - Supabase client
@stripe/stripe-js and @stripe/react-stripe-js - Stripe checkout
Stripe webhooks to confirm payments and create orders in Supabase

Typical flow:
User browses → adds to cart (stored in Supabase) → clicks checkout → Stripe handles payment → webhook confirms → order saved in Supabase → confirmation email sent
Pro tips for electronics:

Use Supabase's PostgreSQL for complex product relationships (bundles, compatible accessories)
Add product comparison feature - customers love this for electronics
Build a robust filter system for specs (brand, price, features)
